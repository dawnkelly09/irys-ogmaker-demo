## Open Graph object maker

This is a little demo tool I made to generate Open Graph protocol compliant html files from user form inputs. Submitting the form will generate an html file in the public/ogFiles directory as well as loading the html for storage via Irys. Be sure to check your terminal for the Irys url where you can find your stored object!

I made this to generate custom OG files to use as custom embeds with the tldraw canvas. You could also just use it to  generate OG meta tags to add to your own websites. 

You'll need the [Irys sdk](https://docs.irys.xyz/developer-docs/irys-sdk) & to add your own private key, etc to use this tool. ðŸ«¡
